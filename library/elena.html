    <h1>About Elena</h1>


<p>Elena LaFourcade brings energy, clarity, and innovation to the business operations of The Library at Crescent. Born and raised in a vibrant Chicago neighborhood, she grew up surrounded by storytellers—family members who valued books, music, and community gatherings. That early exposure sparked her interest in how community spaces function and inspired her to pursue studies in nonprofit management and public administration.
<br><br>
Before joining the library, Elena worked with several small community organizations, helping them modernize their budgets, expand programs, and build stronger relationships with the people they served. Her work often took her traveling across the Midwest, where she learned firsthand how important accessible, welcoming libraries are to the heart of a community.
<br><br>
In her free time, Elena enjoys yoga, photography, and exploring local cafés with her notebook in hand. She’s passionate about creating sustainable growth for the library, ensuring every program, event, and resource reflects the needs of its patrons. With her thoughtful leadership and deep commitment to public service, Elena helps guide the library toward a bright, community-focused future.</p>
