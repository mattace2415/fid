    <h1>About Sue</h1>
    <p>
        Mrs. Margaret Thompson has been a cherished part of the Library at Crescent family for more than two decades. Raised in a small coastal town in Maine, she developed a lifelong love for stories by spending afternoons in her grandmother’s attic, thumbing through boxes of old novels and handwritten letters. Before joining the library, she spent years traveling across the country with her late husband, visiting historic towns, art museums, and every independent bookstore she could find. Those travels deepened her appreciation for community spaces where stories and people come together.

        Outside of work, Mrs. Thompson loves gardening, watercolor painting, and tending to her collection of antique teacups—many of which she picked up during her travels. Her passion for the library goes far beyond her daily duties; she believes the library is a second home for anyone seeking knowledge, comfort, or connection. With her warm demeanor, sharp organizational skills, and genuine care for each visitor, Mrs. Thompson continues to help the library flourish as a welcoming haven for all.
